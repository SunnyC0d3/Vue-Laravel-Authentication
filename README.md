#A JWT Application using Vue and Laravel

The purpose of this application was to learn Laravel. Exploring how to configure databases, controllers, views, models, and much more.

As I was going about learning practically, I decided to give myself a challenge to create a Login and Register system using Tokens. I have previous knowledge on building applications via Sessions, but as more new technologies rely on Tokens for stateless applications, I thought now would be a good time to give it a go.

After building the necessary steps for the application, it was tested via Postman and the results were as expected. The only thing left to do was to output the results on to the frontend, which was achieved via Vue. Again never touched Vue before.

This project was essentially a learning curve for understanding Laravel, Vue and JWT's.
